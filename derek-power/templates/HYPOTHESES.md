# Investigation Hypotheses

## Current Theories

### Hypothesis 1: [Theory Name]
- **Theory**: [What you think is happening]
- **Reasoning**: [Why you think this is the case]
- **Evidence Needed**: [What would prove/disprove this]
- **Status**: [Untested/Testing/Confirmed/Refuted]
- **Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]

### Hypothesis 2: [Theory Name]
- **Theory**: [What you think is happening]
- **Reasoning**: [Why you think this is the case]
- **Evidence Needed**: [What would prove/disprove this]
- **Status**: [Untested/Testing/Confirmed/Refuted]
- **Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]

## Validation Plan

### Test Scenario 1
- **Hypothesis**: [Which theory this tests]
- **Method**: [How to test it]
- **Expected Result**: [What should happen if theory is correct]
- **Actual Result**: [What actually happened]
- **Conclusion**: [What this tells us]

### Test Scenario 2
- **Hypothesis**: [Which theory this tests]
- **Method**: [How to test it]

- **Actual Result**: [What actually happened]
- **Conclusion**: [What this tells us]

## Confirmed Findings

### ✅ Confirmed Theory 1
- **Theory**: [What was proven correct]

## Alternative Theories
*Theories that emerged during investigation but haven't been tested yet*

### Alternative 1: [Theory Name]
- **Theory**: [Alternative explanation]
- **Likelihood**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Priority**: [Should this be tested next?]

### Alternative 2: [Theory Name]
- **Theory**: [Alternative explanation]
- **Likelihood**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Priority**: [Should this be tested next?]

## Investigation Logic
*Track the reasoning process and how theories evolved*

1. **Initial Observation**: [What started the investigation]
2. **First Theory**: [Initial hypothesis]
3. **Evidence Gathering**: [What was collected]
4. **Theory Evolution**: [How thinking changed]
5. **Final Conclusion**: [What was ultimately determined]
